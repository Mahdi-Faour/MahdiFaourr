In fact, it is used as a tool for other investigations of fundamental quantum-mechanical phenomena. For example, the form of the Hamiltonian (2.49) can be derived for pointlike particles, such as electrons or muons, which obey the Dirac equation, for which the gyromagnetic ratio g = 2. (See Section 8.2.) However, higher-order corrections from quantum ﬁeld theory predict a small but precisely calculable deviation from this, and it is a high priority to produce competitively precise measurements of g − 2.', metadata={'source': '/content/quantum2.pdf'}), Document(page_content='2.1 Time Evolution and the Schrödinger Equation\\n\\nThe ﬁrst important point we should keep in mind is that time is just a parameter in quantum mechanics, not an operator. In particular, time is not an observable in the language of the previous chapter. It is nonsensical to talk about the time operator in the same sense as we talk about the position operator. Ironically, in the historical development of wave mechanics both L. de Broglie and E. Schr¨odinger were guided by a kind of covariant analogy between energy and time on the one hand and momentum and position (spatial coordinate) on the other. Yet when we now look at quantum mechanics in its ﬁnished form, there is no trace of a symmetrical treatment between time and space. The relativistic quantum theory of ﬁelds does treat the time and space coordinates on the same footing, but it does so only at the expense of demoting position from the status of being an observable to that of being just a parameter.\\n\\n2.1.1 Time-Evolution Operator\\n\\nOur basic concern in this section is, How does a state ket change with time? Suppose we have a physical system whose state ket at t0 is represented by |α(cid:8). At later times, we do not, in general, expect the system to remain in the same state |α(cid:8). Let us denote the ket corresponding to the state at some later time by\\n\\n|α, t0; t(cid:8)\\n\\n(t > t0),\\n\\nwhere we have written α, t0 to remind ourselves that the system used to be in state |α(cid:8) at some earlier reference time t0.

For a physical system with classical analogues, we assume the Hamiltonian to be of the same form as in classical physics; we merely replace the classical xi and pi by the corresponding operators in quantum mechanics. With this assumption we can reproduce the correct classical equations in the classical limit. Whenever an ambiguity arises because of noncommuting observables, we attempt to resolve it by requiring H to be Hermitian; for instance, we write the quantum-mechanical analogue of the classical product xp as 1 2 (xp + px). When the physical system in question has no classical analogues, we can only guess the structure of the Hamiltonian operator. We try various forms until we get the Hamiltonian that leads to results agreeing with empirical observation.\\n\\nIn practical applications it is often necessary to evaluate the commutator of xi (or pi)\\n\\nwith functions of xj and pj. To this end the following formulas are found to be useful:\\n\\n[xi, F(p)] = i¯h\\n\\n∂F ∂pi\\n\\nand\\n\\n[ pi, G(x)] = −i¯h\\n\\n∂G ∂xi\\n\\n,', metadata={'source': '/content/quantum2.pdf'})]\n"

It is extraordinary that such an effect has indeed been observed experimentally; see Figure 2.10 taken from a 1975 experiment of R. Colella, A. Overhauser, and S. A. Werner. The phase shift due to gravity is seen to be veriﬁed to well within 1%.\\n\\nWe emphasize that this effect is purely quantum mechanical because as ¯h → 0, the interference pattern gets washed out. The gravitational potential has been shown to enter into the Schr¨odinger equation just as expected. This experiment also shows that gravity is not purely geometric at the quantum level because the effect depends on (m/¯h)2.14\\n\\n14 However, this does not imply that the equivalence principle is unimportant in understanding an effect of this sort. If the gravitational mass (mgrav) and inertial mass (minert) were unequal, (m/¯h)2 would have to be replaced by mgravminert/¯h2.

A laser precisely measures the small deflection, from which the force is deduced. The force (measured in 10−12 N) varies as a function of separation between the sphere and the plate, in excellent agreement with the prediction, shown by the line through the data points, based on a quantized electromagnetic field.\\n\\nThus, there is an attractive force between the plates which varies as the inverse fourth power of the separation, due to the reconﬁguration of the vacuum energy in the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld.', metadata={'source': '/content/quantum2.pdf'}), Document(page_content='7.8.1 Maxwell’s Equations in Free Space\\n\\nIn the absence of any charges or currents, Maxwell’s equations (in Gaussian units; see Appendix A) take the form\\n\\n∇ · E = 0 ∇ · B = 0 ∂B 1 ∂t c ∂E ∇ × B − 1 ∂t c\\n\\n∇ × E +\\n\\n= 0\\n\\n= 0.\\n\\nFollowing standard procedure, we postulate a vector potential A(x, t) such that\\n\\nB = ∇ × A\\n\\nwhich means that (7.160b) is immediately satisﬁed.

These operators commute with each other if they have integer spin, and anticommute for half-integer spin. Work needs to be done in order to build in relativistic covariance, but it is relatively straightforward. It is also, however, not necessary if the problem does not warrant it.
